    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        My name is Shane Gianelli, I am a $age year old software developer from
        Arizona, preparing to move to Seattle, Washington in the next couple of
        months as I graduate college.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been a freelancer since I was 16, working mostly on iOS
        applications at the time, and have since expanded to projects involving
        PHP, Python, .NET, J2EE, Node.js, C#, ActionScript and so on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently I work on enterprise software solutions for Elegant Thought
        LLC in Tucson, Arizona and have plans to expand their footprint to
        Seattle as part of my move.  I will be graduating from the University of
        Arizona in less than 3 weeks with a Bachelors of Science in Computer
        Science, exactly one year early.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout college I have maintained a 30 to 50 hour workweek at Elegant
        Thought and other jobs, including work on my own projects so being out
        of school is going to certainly be dramatic change in pace for me and I
        am excited to increase the amount of time that I will have to work on
        software related projects.
