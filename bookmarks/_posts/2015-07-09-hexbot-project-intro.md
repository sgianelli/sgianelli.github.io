[Hexbot Project Intro](http://www.gperco.com/2015/06/hex-project-intro.html)

While I am not much of a hardware hacker, I find this guys writing style is
extremely informative, educational, and the things he does are just loads of
fun to read about. I highly recommend his entire blog. Specifically, I want to
highlight his latest series of posts about building a hexbot almost entirely
from scratch including all the mechanical and software problems he had to solve
along the way.
