[Git from the inside out](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out)

This is a really great article for learning how and why <pre>git</pre> works the way that it does. After reading it I would definitely say that I have a significantly better understanding of how to use <pre>git</pre> and what is actually going on so that I make far fewer mistakes. Must read for those newer to the vcs.
